2.7.5:
------

NetBSD and general pkgsrc compatibility.  Should get rid of the only
patch used in pkgsrc.

2.7.4:
------

Print the message that we switch to normal from O_DIRECT only when
verbose > 0.

2.7.3:
------

More c flags changes for more portability.

2.7.2:
------

Fix compilation under Redhat-7.3.

2.7.1:
------

Support for $CSTREAM_AUDIO_BITRATE.

2.7.0:
------

Support for O_SYNC and O_DIRECT, but only on the output side for now.

Please send mail if you want this for input.

2.6.1:
------

Timer-based throughput reports from -T<n> will now also print what the
throughput since the last report was.  Useful when performance changes
during runtime.

2.6.0:
------

Bandwidth limiting was not > 4 GB clean on platforms with 32 bit
integers.  I had lost an already existing fix here.


2.5.2:
------

Commandline options, options to -O and -I:
-ON
-IN

which prevents cstream from interpreting filenames with ":" in them as
TCP specifications.  By default the presense of a colon means host:port.

2.5.1:
------

Add option -T <interval> which will print the statistics every
<interval> seconds.

2.5:
----

There was a 4 GB limitation on 32 bit machines when you used bandwith
limiting.  Thanks to Sergey M. Serov for reporting!

2.4.1b:
-------

Use SO_REUSEADDR on serving socket.

2.4:
----

Bandwidth limiting is not not only as a strict maximum at any point in
time but now you can also limit for the session as a whole.  Do so by
giving a negative bandwidth limit.  To make it clear: if the session
was running below the limit for some time for other bottlenecks in the
chain, then it will run above the limit to make good for it at other
times when it can.

2.3:
----

Identical to 2.3b3, sigchld handling is assumed to be correct now and
works with various versions of the Linux kernel.

Version 2.3 has sound support, see e.g. `cstream -Oa -o /dev/dsp`.

2.3b3:
------

Further SIGCHLD fixes.

2.3b2:
------

Fix SIGCHLD handling so that stopping and continuing the child in a
concurrent mode would not terminate.

2.3b1:
------

Version 2.3 has sound support, see e.g. `cstream -Oa -o /dev/dsp`

version 2.2:
------------

TCP/IP socket support.

Linux glibc 64 bit files.

Version 2.1:
------------

- Add audio mode: -O a/-I a try to switch output file into CD-quality
  16bit 44100Hz stereo mode.  If input is just generated, a sine wave
  of 440 Hz will be played.
- Add tee-fd mode.  -O t will copy the stream to file descriptor 3
  (which must already be opened by parent process).

Version 2.0:
------------
- Add -c flag for concurrent mode.
- Add -B flag (buffering of multiple input blocks before output
  blocks are written).
- Add -l flag (statistics will include line count).
- If input data is just 'generated', use a buffer that remotely
  resembles ASCII text with a line length of 76 chars and has a
  newline at the end of data.
- Number of bytes transferred is also displayed in GB/MB/KB, if
  appriopriate. 
- Change throughput report to be shorter.
- Add automatic tests `make check`.
- Througput reporting on signals got the wrong time when cstream was
  not called with -v > 0.
- Use SIGINFO for throughput report.
- Use more values from configure script.
- Throughput report is now asynchronous, not after next read() or write().
- Throughput report will report buffer fillage if -B is in use.

Version 1.4:
------------

- Fix Linux compilation problems.
- The -b and -t options now also recognize 'k', 'm', 'g' for kilo-,
  mega-, gigabyte like the -n option did.
- The signal for shutdown is now SIGUSR2, not SIGHUP.

Version 1.3:
------------

- Fix permissions of created files
- You can now specify the input file without using a switch (if it is
  the last argument)
- Improve messages

Version 1.2:
------------

- Argument checking for -v was broken, fixed.

Version 1.1:
------------ 

- Fix version number reporting, introduce -V switch.
- Fix usage() typos.

Version 1.0:
------------

- Initial version.
